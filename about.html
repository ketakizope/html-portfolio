<P>I am a third-year student studying Information Technology engineering at Don Bosco College in India. 
  I enjoy my studies and find the world of technology fascinating. Outside of my academic life, 
  I have a strong passion for art, crafts, and designing. These hobbies allow me to relax and express my creativity.
   I love creating intricate designs and working on various art projects. This creative side helps me think outside
   the box and brings a unique touch to my technical skills.</p>
  
  <p>Living in India, I am inspired by the rich culture and traditions around me.
   I often spend my free time working on art and craft projects with my friends. 
  I also have a deep love for nature and enjoy exploring new places, capturing beautiful
   moments through photography.
   Additionally, I like trying out new dishes and experimenting with different cuisines.</p>
